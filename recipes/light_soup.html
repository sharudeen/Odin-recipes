    <p class="shortnote">Light Soup is a local indigenous soup of the GaDangme(or Ga) people of the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. Originally formulated as a 'Tomatoes-Base Sea Fish Light Soup' called 'Aklo(or Aklor)' for fishermen at the coast of Accra, but over the course of time it evolved into a soup prepared with both 'fish and goat-meat', or 'fish and lamb-meat', or 'fish and beef', or 'exclusively the meat of the livestock of choice', and of which the GaDangmes(or Gas) call 'Toolo Wonu', but their neighbouring 'Akans' call 'Aponkye Nkrakra'.</p>

    <p class="shortnote">You can make this soup without garden eggs and turkey berries, boil the tomatoes with onions and pepper and continue with the process. Alternatively, you can replace vegetable stock with water. Add just enough vegetable stock as you will need depending on how light you want the soup.</p>
